                    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Predict Boston property price by analyzing data scraped from <a href="https://www.trulia.com/">trulia.com</a> using advanced regression models. I will go in-depth for all the processes of this project: from using <code>Beautiful Soup</code> to scrape data, to analyze and compare different regression models, and building an Application Programming Interface (API) using a micro web framework in Python: <code>Flask</code>.</p>
<p>For in-depth step-by-step code analysis, the repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/chilam27/Boston_Housing_Prices">here</a>.</p>
<p>My goal for this project is to use the best regression model to predict Boston housing prices on Trulia based on the number of features that the source provides. By the end of the project, I am hoping to be able to answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the features that have a high effect on the rent of a property? Does the neighborhood of the property have any effect?</li>
<li>How good is our prediction for the rent of the property?</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I have done a simple regression model with my previous project (<a href="https://github.com/chilam27/GDP_Fertility_Mortality_Relation">&ldquo;GDP_Fertility_Mortality_Relation&rdquo;</a>), I want to improve my skill sets and prediction accuracy even more. In this project, I have three main focuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to scrape a website with Python.</li>
<li>Understand the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and how it contributes to the outcome.</li>
<li>Introduce the productization stage into my project.</li>
</ol>
<p>One more improvement I apply in this project is using different regression models and improve its performance by fine fine-tuning the parameters using <code>GridSearchCV</code>.</p>
<h1 id="general-project-outline">General Project Outline</h1>
<ol>
<li>Data collection: use <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to scrape property data from Trulia, a popular real estate website. Gather all listed variables that can be used for data analysis.</li>
<li>Data cleaning: read in data and prepare it for data analysis; steps include: tidy up the categorical features, deal with null values, etc.</li>
<li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA): examine the cleaned data and its trends so we can choose an appropriate model that can be applied.</li>
<li>Model building: determine which model (<code>Linear</code>, <code>Lasso</code>, <code>Random Forest</code>, <code>XGBoost</code>) work best (that return the smallest error) and tune the model with different parameters using <code>GridSearchCV</code>.</li>
<li>Productionize model: create a <em>local</em> API to get quick access to the regression model with a given input set.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Disclaimer: this data set is used for educational puspose.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To evaluate the performance of our model, I will use the mean absolute error (MAE) as the metric for this project. The reason for choosing this metric is because it can represent, on average, how far off our prediction is.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<p>Starting with data collection, I have never learned how to scrape a website before. Therefore, I want to give the acknowledgment of the code used for scrapping to Karishma Parashar (the GitHub repository for her code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Abmun/WebScraping-RentalProperties">here</a>). Her code gives a nice outline of the process. Though there are some bugs that I needed to fix for the code to run properly and to get the type of data and the amount I needed. I started the scrapping procedure on June 25h, 2020. My goal is to scrape, at most, 240 records (not all search terms will result in at least 240 records) from each neighborhood of Boston and convert it to a CSV file. I have collected 3,894 records and 12 different variables. One thing to note is the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; variable: I could not code the scrapping process to attain all features because of the &ldquo;See All&rdquo; button that hides some of the data. Do not rely heavily on this variable when doing analysis.</p>
<p><em>Neighborhoods as search key terms: East Boston, Charlestown, Allston, North End, West End, Downtown, Chinatown, Back Bay/ Beacon Hill, South Boston, South End, Fenway, Mission Hill, Roxbury, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, Roslindale, West Roxbury, Hyde Park.</em></p>
<p>Here is a list of variables that I scrapped from Trulia:</p>
<ol>
<li>rent: the rent of the property for 1 month.</li>
<li>address: the address of the property.</li>
<li>area: neighborhood the property located.</li>
<li>bed: number of beds provided.</li>
<li>bath: number of bathrooms provided.</li>
<li>school: number of school around the area.</li>
<li>crime: crime rate of the area.</li>
<li>commute: percentage of people commute by car.</li>
<li>shop_eat: number of shops and restaurants in the area.</li>
<li>description: description of the property.</li>
<li>feature: items that property provides (heating, laundry, etc.).</li>
<li>URL: link to the property.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>During the data cleaning stage, I check to see if there are any missing values and clean up the text for each column. Then, I apply feature engineering to columns &ldquo;school&rdquo;, &ldquo;shop_eat&rdquo;, and &ldquo;feature&rdquo; to extract more data and make it easier for the machine to perform data analysis. Here is what the data frame looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig1_1.png" alt="image info"></p>
<h2 id="eda">EDA</h2>
<p>After preparing the data, next is the data interpretation in the EDA stage. First, I want to look at the general information of the variables. From figure 2, there are three pieces of information I can see: I have about 3259 records of property, there is no missing value, and the data set only consists of 3 categorical variables and 20 numerical variables.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig2.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>Next, I will perform univariate analysis on the target variable: &ldquo;rent&rdquo; by caculating the skewness and kurtosis of the variableand, and plotting the value and examine if the distribution shape is normal. From the table and graph below, we can see that: since the original data has high positve skewness and kurtosis (the curve is formed by a huge cluster of mid-range properties and few expensive properties that cause it to have a right skew), I normalize the data by performing log transformation and it resulted very close to a normal distribution.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig3.png" alt="image info">
<img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig4.png" alt="image info">
<img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig5.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>I also perform multivariate analysis on the target variable by having &ldquo;bed&rdquo; and &ldquo;bath&rdquo; as an additional dependent variable and see the relationship between rent and the number of beds and bathrooms a property has. With the plot below, there is an upward trend between the relationships.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig6.png" alt="image info">    <img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig7.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>To decrease the skewness and make the general distribution even more normal, I identify the outliers using Z-score and remove it from the data set. Here is the &ldquo;rent&rdquo; distribution resulting from having the outliers removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig8.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>Heatmap is a very useful tool to see how variables are correlated with each other. From figure 9, there are many interesting details that we need to pay attention to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;bed&rdquo;, &ldquo;bath&rdquo;, &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo;, &ldquo;grocery&rdquo;, and &ldquo;nightlife&rdquo;, accordingly, have the highest correlation with the target variable. Though they are less correlated than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the school variables are highly correlated with each other. This is predicted since the values were derived from a single variable during our cleaning phase. Similar can be said with &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo;, &ldquo;grocery&rdquo;, and &ldquo;nightlife&rdquo; (they came from a variable that is called &ldquo;shop_eat&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the features variables interesting have a lower correlation with the target variable. Keep in mind that we will not use much of these data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig9.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>Observed only those numerical variables that have a high correlation with the target variable with a zoomed heatmap. Since we have mentioned that &lsquo;restaurant&rsquo;, &lsquo;grocery&rsquo;, and &lsquo;nightlife&rsquo; are pretty similar, we can remove two of the variables and keep &lsquo;grocery&rsquo; for now for analysis (figure 12)</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig10.png" alt="image info">    <img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig11.png" alt="image info">
<img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig12.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>Next, I examine the categorical variable. I explore the &ldquo;area&rdquo; variable with the assumption that: depends on the neighborhood, the general trend for the rent of a property might be different. Here, I make a pie chart shows the proportion of area that each neighborhood takes up and a boxplot of the relationship between &ldquo;area&rdquo; and &ldquo;rent&rdquo;. By looking at the mean and its ranges, there seems to be some correlation. Another thing worth noting is the number of outliers presented in almost every neighborhood.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig13_1.png" alt="image info">    <img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig14_1.png" alt="image info">
<img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig15_1.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p>My final task for this stage is to examine &ldquo;property_type&rdquo; and &ldquo;crime&rdquo; and their relation with &ldquo;rent&rdquo;. Because there is an imbalance proportion of data for &ldquo;property_type&rdquo; (apartment 3%, condo &gt; 0.1%, multi 96%, single 1%, townhouse and condo are &gt; 1%), it can be hard to examine the relationship accurately. Based on the graph, we can see a representation of what it would look like: multi-family and townhouse have about the same median, a little bit higher than that are single-family; although apartment seems to have the same median as a condo, I believe if we have enough data points, condos would be the property with the highest rent.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;crime&rdquo; in figure 17, Moderate and Low crime rates have the same median and range. Although the High rate does have a similar median but interestingly has a higher range. The two most surprising ones are the Lowest and Highest rates: while Lowest one also has the lowest median and, arguably, range, the Highest rate has the highest median. I expected it to be the opposite of these two. Based on this, maybe more expensive properties attract more crime than lower ones?</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig16_17.png" alt="image info"></p>
<h2 id="regression-model">Regression Model</h2>
<p>Split the data to training (80%) and testing (20%) sets in a stratify fashion with strata are the different neighborhoods. The reason for this is because I want to have coverage of the entire area in the Boston city and some neighborhood have significantly lower data than others.</p>
<p>Testing assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Normality/ Linearity: when I was investigating our rent variable during the EDA stage, I have transformed the data into log so it can prevent underfitting. But I tested it again for our train data to be sure also (figure 18 and 19).</li>
<li>Homoscedasticity: I included all variables to eliminate heteroscedasticity.</li>
<li>Absence of Multicollinearity: though I have tried to remove variables that are highly correlated to each other, I found in the result of regression models that by including every variable I was able to get a higher accuracy rate.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig18.png" alt="image info">    <img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig19.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p><strong>Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression</strong>, by being one of the simplest estimators for a simple model, is easier to implement and interpret compare to other sophisticated ones. Although it might not work well with my project that has many variables and correlations to the target is weak, I gave it a shot. Besides the table of correlation that I already have a general picture of what it is like, a statistical measurement that I am interested in is the &ldquo;R-squared&rdquo; (coefficient of determination) of 0.661. This means that our model fits well and we can predict about 66.1% of our trained data set. Keep in mind that although the difference between &ldquo;R-squared&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adj. R-squared&rdquo; (0.657)is not too significant, but it let us know that there are some irrelevant features that we have included in our model. Another interesting measurement is &ldquo;F-statistics&rdquo; that has value above 100 (152.3) and &ldquo;Prop (F-statistics)&rdquo; that has a value below 0.05 (0.00). By having these two measurements meeting the condition, it means that there is a good linear relationship between the target and all the feature variables.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig20.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p><em>Throughout all of the model, I will implement cross validation to eliminate the probability that the model might be over fitting or contains bias</em></p>
<p><strong>Multiple linear regression</strong> (this is the same model of what we have discussed above, but I use mean absolute error here as my measurement of the model accuracy) returns a MAE of <em>-393.7313</em> for trained data set</p>
<p><strong>Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression</strong> contrasts with the model above. I tested out the Lasso regression model because of its ability to analyze data set with large features very well. That is not the only reason for applying in this model because I want to see how its L1 regularization technique works (helps with eliminating overfitting). For this model, I have tested out a range of alpha from 1 to 100 with an increment of 10. By finding the maximum error of the curve of the plot below, we have alpha = 1.7. It returned a MAE of <em>-392.8202</em> for trained data set.</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig21.png" alt="image info"></p>
<p><strong>Random forest regression</strong>  applies some different techniques to predict the data: it uses multiple decision tree and bagging (or bootstrap aggregation) to better understand the bias and variance of the data. Because it also works well with a large data set, I applied this model to our data to see how it does compare to other models. It returned a MAE of <em>-306.6928</em> for trained data set.</p>
<p><strong>XGBoost</strong> is known for its ability to outperform any of its competitors, XGBoost is my last algorithm of choice to predict our data. Different from random forest regression, it uses boosting technique (combining weak learners to strong ones to improve prediction accuracy). It is also powerful for a wide range of parameters to really fine-tune the algorithm. It returned a MAE of <em>-343.4491</em> for trained data set.</p>
<h2 id="overall-model-performance">Overall Model Performance</h2>
<p>Before finalizing our model, I made three different adjustments to the data to see if it can improve the prediction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Size: initially, after finished cleaning the data, I trimmed the data set from 3000+ records to about 759 records. I trimmed it based on the proportion of the area that each neighborhood takes relative to the area of the city. The reason why the size is small is because of neighborhoods, such as Hyde Park and Mattapan, which have very few records on Trulia. But it turned out that it does not give a very good prediction as if I leave the size as it is. This concluded that the larger the sample size is the better the prediction is.</li>
<li>Stratification: in order for our sample to accurately represent the city of Boston, I make sure all neighborhoods are present in the training data set. As it turned out, this also resulted in a better prediction for our model.</li>
<li>Eliminate irrelevant features: recalling back to our heat maps from above, there are only a few variables that give me the correlation with the target variable that is above 0.2. I thought, by removing the irrelevant features and those that highly correlated to each other, would increase the performance. But it did not turn about to be like that. I am still unsure of why this is the case. But by including all variables, it seems to perform better (the larger the number of features is the better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two things in the list of our prediction models&rsquo; outcomes that surprised me: there is only 0.9 improvement in lasso regression compare to the multiple linear regression and the random forest regression outperformed the XGBoost algorithm by 36.7 dollar. Because of this, I will apply an exhaustive <code>GridSearchCV</code> to search for the best parameters for the random forest regression. Although I have tried to exhausted tuning with many more parameters such as &ldquo;max_depth&rdquo; and &ldquo;min_samples_leaf&rdquo;, it took too much time so I did a simple one instead (so the difference of the result is not huge). With the best parameters for the best performance model through the training data set, now it is the time to implement it to our test data set too see how well our model can predict the prices of property in Boston:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple linear regression:  1469.1753603498644</li>
<li>Lasso regression:  393.3840532780861</li>
<li>XGBoost regression:  403.93248876337</li>
<li><strong>Random forest regression regression (using best parameters through GridSearchCV):  316.51083201892743</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="productionization">Productionization</h2>
<p>For this part of the project, I followed Chris I. article &ldquo;Productionize a Machine Learning model with Flask and Heroku&rdquo; and applied it for my project. Below is a screenshot of how the outcome looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/images/blog/P02_fig22_1.png" alt="image info"></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>With our best prediction model returns the MAE of 316.51 for the test data set, the model does predict the property&rsquo;s price according to the features that are used quite accurately. The MAE value of 316.51 means that on average, our prediction is off around 316.51. That is acceptable considering how low our correlation values are. We concluded that a fine tune random forest regression works the best in predicting property&rsquo;s rent based on 19 of the used features.</p>
<p>Although my first intention was to follow the tutorial by Chris I. and productionize the model into a public API with Flask and Heroku, because I could not spend more time to tackle problems I had with Heroku so I made it local instead (I have attached my progress and the problem that I was on in figures below).</p>
